# Welcome to My WebSite!

This website was created to fulfill **Web Technology** moduleâ€™s requirements and does not represent an actual company or service


# Files

Here I have folder with **components** which I used to make this website, so this files does not represent any value. Also I used normalize.css file. [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.
